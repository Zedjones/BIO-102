* The Senses
** Sensory Nervous System
*** Interaction of sensory receptors and your nervous system response to those stimuli
*** General (somatic) senses
    Temperature, touch, pain, pressure, body position
*** Special senses
    Smell, taste, hearing, vision, equilibrium
  Difference is how whether or not these are spread across the body or in a
  specialized region 
** Inner Ear Damage Can lead to Hearing Loss
  Cancer, noise explosion, menieres disease, genetic connexcin 26, toys -
  noise levels, membrane rupture, airbag deployment, premature birth
* For exam
  Be able to trace path of sound from outside to nervous system
  Pinna -> auditory canal -> eardrum -> ossicles -> cochlea 
* Outer Layer of the Eye: Sclera
** Cornea - front of the yee, the sclera becomes transparent
  lets light into the eye
  helps focus light 
* Middle Layer of the Eye: Choroid
** Choroid - the sclera surrounds the pigmented layer
** Blood vessels for eye
** Ciliary Muscle
  extends from anterior portion of choroid - holds lens in place
  contract/relax muscle - change pupil size 
** Iris
  Thin ring of pigmented muscle in front of lens 
  Regulates amount of light entering eye
