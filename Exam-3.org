* Chapter 26 - The Endocrine System
  - Slower than the nervous system, chemical messages
   - Produce longer effects
  - Master gland is pituitary 
  - Hormone can only trigger reaction in target cells
   - These cells have receptors
   - Not one-to-one
  - Pancreas
   - Beta cells release insulin
   - Alpha cells release glucagon  
  - Graves' Disease
   - Overproduction of thyroid hormones, hyperthyroidism
   - Auto-immune disorders create antibody that mimic the thryoid stimulating
     hormones 
  - Hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis
   - Sets the thyroid gland in motion to maintain homeostasis 
   - Hypothalamus triggers the anterior pituitary which releases thyroid
     stimulating hormone
    - This hormone, if you were cold, would stimulate the cells to burn
      glucose (break it down) to produce ATP and increase your temperature
   - Stops from a negative feedback loop detected by hypothalamus and
     pituitary gland
  - Lipid-soluble hormones
   - Cross the membranes of target cells, binds in the nucleus  
  - Thyroid functions
   - Maintaining blood pressure
   - Promoting the growth of tissues
   - Triggering the secretion of digestive juices
