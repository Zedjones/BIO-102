* Chapter 26 - The Endocrine System
  - Slower than the nervous system, chemical messages
   - Produce longer effects
  - Master gland is pituitary 
  - Hormone can only trigger reaction in target cells
   - These cells have receptors
   - Not one-to-one
  - Pancreas
   - Beta cells release insulin
   - Alpha cells release glucagon  
  - Graves' Disease
   - Overproduction of thyroid hormones, hyperthyroidism
   - Auto-immune disorders create antibody that mimic the thryoid stimulating
     hormones 
  - Hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis
   - Sets the thyroid gland in motion to maintain homeostasis 
   - Hypothalamus triggers the anterior pituitary which releases thyroid
     stimulating hormone
    - This hormone, if you were cold, would stimulate the cells to burn
      glucose (break it down) to produce ATP and increase your temperature
   - Stops from a negative feedback loop detected by hypothalamus and
     pituitary gland
  - Lipid-soluble hormones
   - Cross the membranes of target cells, binds to receptors in the nucleus  
  - Water-soluble hormones
   - Receptors on outside of membranes  
  - Thyroid functions
   - Maintaining blood pressure
   - Promoting the growth of tissues
   - Triggering the secretion of digestive juices
  - The gonads secrete sex hormones in response to secretion of
    follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the
    anterior pituitary
  - Nerve signals travel from the hypothalamus to the spinal cord to the
    adrenal medulla, which secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine during the
    "fight-or-flight" response  
* Chapter 28 - The Nervous System
  - Peripheral Nervous System
   - Sensory Division (Afferent)
    - Picks up sensory stimuli 
   - Motor Divison (Efferent)
    - Sends directions from your brain to muscles and glands
    - Somatic Nervous System
    - Autonomic Nervous System
     - Sympathetic Division 
     - Parasympathetic Division 
  - Glial Cells
   - Provide support, nutrition, insulation, and help with signal
     transmission in the nervous system
     - *Much more of these than neurons*
   - Schwann Cells
    - Produce the myelin sheath
  - Neural Pathway
   - Sensory neurons -> CNS -> interneurons -> PNS -> motor neurons 
  - Voltage is the measure of potential energy generated by separated
    charges, called membrane potential within neurons (measured in mV) 
   - A nerve signal, or action potential, is a change in the membrane voltage
     that transmits a nerve signal along an axon 
    - At rest, more negative on the inside of the membrane than the outside
     - Resting potential (-70 mV)/polarized 
     - Sodium ions outside, negatively charged proteins and potassium ions
       inside 
     - Sodium/potassium pump helps maintain this equillibrium 
   - Sodium channels are voltage-gated
    - Action potential triggers these
   - Action Potential
    - All or nothing, must hit -55 mV and then action potential is propogated
    - After stimuli, sodium channels open and sodium ions rush in and make
      inside more positive than outside (40 mV)
     - In turn causes more voltage gated channels to open and continues down
       the axon 
     - Voltage-gated potassium channels are then triggered and lead to a
       repolarization of the membrane
       - Voltage initially drops too far until the pumps kick in 
    - Frequency of action potential changes, not the strength  
   - Synapses
    - Electrical
     - Current flows directly from a neuron through gap junctions 
    - Chemical
     - The sending cell secretes a chemical signal, a neurotransmitter, which
       crosses the synaptic cleft. 
       - The neurotransmitters are stored in the synpatic vesicles
        - Voltage gated calcium channels opening from action potential cause
          the vesicle to fused with the presynaptic membrane and release the
          neurotransmitter
         - The neurotransmitter bind to receptor sites on the postsynaptic
           neuron 
           - Depending on the neurotransmitter, the receiving neurons might
             get excited or inhibited
             - Excitatory makes the inside of the neuron more positive
               (depolarization)
             - Inhibitory makes the inside of the neuron more negative
               (hyperpolarization)
     - The neurotransmitter binds to a specific receptor on the surface of
       the receiving cell
     - These enable more complex information to be processed 
* Chapter 29 - The Senses
 - Taste and Smell
  - Both of these use chemoreceptors
  - Olfactory epithelium is the beginning of smell sensations
   - Olfactory bulbs have a direct connection to the limbic system  
  - All tastes register in all parts of the tongue
   - Taste buds sit behind the epithelial tissue of the tongue
    - Gustatory cells
     - Gustatory hairs detect tastes and create an action potential  
    - Basal cells
     - Replace gustatory cells every week 
 - Hearing and Balance
  - Vibrations cause air particles to vibrate, initiating sound waves that
    carry vibrations through the air
  - Sounds frequency is the number of waves that pass a certain point in a
    given time frame 
    - This changes the pitch 
  - Amplitude is the different between pressures created in the air by a
    sound wave
    - This changes the volume 
  - *How the ear functions is not included in this study guide*
  - Balance is a result of fluid moving around the semicircular canals, one
    for each of the 3 dimensional planes
    - Utricle and Saccule have hairs that read the movement of this fluid,
      allowing the brain to create a 3 dimensional picture of how the head is
      moving 
    - Sensory conflict occurs in a boat, for example, when the vestibular
      senses tell your brain that you're moving up and down but the eyes tell
      the brain that you're sitting still
      - This leads to motion sickness 
 - Vision
  - Frequency of a light wave determines hue, amplitude relates to brightness     
  - Sclera is the very outside of the eye 
  - Cornea -> pupil -> lens -> retina
  - Photoreceptors don't generate action potentials, but do transduce
    electromagnetic waves to electrical signals
    - Cones
     - Detect fine details and color (R, G, and B cones)
    - Rods
     - Detect grayscale black and white
