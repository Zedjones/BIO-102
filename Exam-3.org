* Chapter 26 - The Endocrine System
  - Slower than the nervous system, chemical messages
   - Produce longer effects
  - Master gland is pituitary 
  - Hormone can only trigger reaction in target cells
   - These cells have receptors
   - Not one-to-one
  - Pancreas
   - Beta cells release insulin
   - Alpha cells release glucagon  
  - Graves' Disease
   - Overproduction of thyroid hormones, hyperthyroidism
   - Auto-immune disorders create antibody that mimic the thryoid stimulating
     hormones 
  - Hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis
   - Sets the thyroid gland in motion to maintain homeostasis 
   - Hypothalamus triggers the anterior pituitary which releases thyroid
     stimulating hormone
    - This hormone, if you were cold, would stimulate the cells to burn
      glucose (break it down) to produce ATP and increase your temperature
   - Stops from a negative feedback loop detected by hypothalamus and
     pituitary gland
  - Lipid-soluble hormones
   - Cross the membranes of target cells, binds to receptors in the nucleus  
  - Water-soluble hormones
   - Receptors on outside of membranes  
  - Thyroid functions
   - Maintaining blood pressure
   - Promoting the growth of tissues
   - Triggering the secretion of digestive juices 
* Chapter 28 - The Nervous System
  - Peripheral Nervous System
   - Sensory Division (Afferent)
    - Picks up sensory stimuli 
   - Motor Divison (Efferent)
    - Sends directions from your brain to muscles and glands
    - Somatic Nervous System
    - Autonomic Nervous System
     - Sympathetic Division 
     - Parasympathetic Division 
  - Glial Cells
   - Provide support, nutrition, insulation, and help with signal
     transmission in the nervous system
   - Schwann Cells
    - Produce the myelin sheath
  - Neural Pathway
   - Sensory neurons -> CNS -> interneurons -> PNS -> motor neurons 
  - Voltage is the measure of potential energy generated by separated
    charges, called membrane potential within neurons (measured in mV) 
   - A nerve signal, or action potential, is a change in the membrane voltage
     that transmits a nerve signal along an axon 
    - At rest, more negative on the inside of the membrane than the outside
     - Resting potential (-70 mV)/polarized 
     - Sodium ions outside, negatively charged proteins and potassium ions
       inside 
     - Sodium/potassium pump helps maintain this equillibrium 
   - Sodium channels are voltage-gated
    - Action potential triggers these
   - Action Potential
    - All or nothing, must hit -55 mV and then action potential is propogated
    - After stimuli, sodium channels open and sodium ions rush in and make
      inside more positive than outside (40 mV)
     - In turn causes more voltage gated channels to open and continues down
       the axon 
     - Voltage-gated potassium channels are then triggered and lead to a
       repolarization of the membrane
       - Voltage initially drops too far until the pumps kick in 
    - Frequency of action potential changes, not the strength
