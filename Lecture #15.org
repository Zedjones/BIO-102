* Chapter 31 - Plant Structure, Growth, and Reproduction
 * Plant Types
  - Gynosperms
   - "naked seeds"
   - Seeds do not develop within an ovary
   - Coniferous trees
  - Angiosperms
   - "One whose seed is carried in a vessel"

  - Modifications of plant parts are adapatations for various functions:
   - Food or water storage
   - Asexual reproduction 
   - Protection
   - Climbing
   - Photosynthesis
  - Examples of Evolutionary Adaptation
   - Stems may be modified as
    - Stolons - asexual reproduction
    - Tubers - storage and asexual reproduction 
    - Rhizomes - storage and asexual reproduction
 * What about leaf modifications?
  - Leaves may be modified for:
   - Climbing, such as a tendril, with its tips coiled around a support
     structure
   - Protection, such as a cactus spine
