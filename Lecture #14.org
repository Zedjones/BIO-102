* Chapter 29 - The Senses 
** The vision pathway from light source to the optic nerve
  - The fovea centralis on the retina contains only cones and is where vision
   is most acute (focused) 
  - NOTE: no photoreceptors at point where nerve exits eyeball = blind spot 
* Chapter 26 - The Endocrine System 
** Chemical and electrical signals coordinate body functions
  - Hormones are 
   - chemical signals
   - produced by endocrine glands 
   - usually carried in the blood 
   - responsible for specific changes in target cells 
  - Hormones may also be released from specialized nerve cells called
    neurosecretory cells 
** Stages of Hormone Signalling
  - Receptions of the signal 
   - occurs when a hormone binds to a specific receptor protein on or in the
     target cell 
  - Signal transduction 
   - converts the  signal from one form to another 
  - Response 
   - change in the cell's behavior
** Homeostatic Mechanisms Hormone Control
  - Negative feedback - shuts down the system; regulatory process 
   - Example:
    - high b.g. levels = release of insulin = blood glucose decreases
    - low b.g. levels = insulin secretion stops 
  - Positive feedback - stimulates process to continue 
   - Example:
    - Oxytocin and child birth
