* Key Reagents to Know
** Trypsin
  - Aids in the digestion of proteins, produced in the pancreas 
  - Further digestion of proteins after initial breakdown by pepsin
** Amylase
  - Aids in the digestion of starch and glycogen, produed in the pancreas
  - Breaks them down into disaccharide maltose molecules
** Bile
*** Emulsifies lipids and is produced in the liver, stored in the gall blader
   - Emulsification is the breakdown of fat globules in the dueodenum into tiny
   droplets, giving more surface area for lipase from the pancrease to work
   on assisted by the bile salts
** Lipase
  - Once lipids are emulsified, they are broken down into their subunits,
  which can be absorbed into the body, by lipase
** Gelatin
  - A protein that is capable of taking up large amounts of water, causing it
  to swell and form a Jell-O like substance
** Hydrochloric Acid
  - Reagent which increases acidity and helps certain enzymatic activity, such
  as pepsin 
** Sodium Hydroxide
  - Reagent which increases pH and helps certain enzymatic activity, such as
  trypsin
** Biuret Solution
  -Used to test for the presence of proteins, is normally blue and turns
  purple in the presence of peptide bonds (from proteins)
** Iodine
  - Used to test for the presence of starch, to determine whether digestion has
  occurred. No starch digestion = golden-brown color, starch digestion =
  red-brown, blue, black
** Starch Solution
  - In our lab, pancreatic extract which contains starch, a polysaccharide
** Phenolphthalein
  - Used as a pH indicator, turns pink at pH 10. As digestion occurs and fatty
  acids are released, will become colorless, indicating that the solution is
  now only slightly basic (pH 8) 
** Benedict's Solution
  - Used to test for the presence of maltose. No maltose = blue, small amount
  of maltose = greenish, moderate amount = yellowish, large amount = orange
  or reddish coloration

* Key Concepts
** Respiratory System
  - [ ] Intercostal muscles
   - Contract during inhalation, relax during exhalation
   - Located between the ribs 
  - [ ] Lungs
   - Located on both sides of the chest 
   - Gas exchange with the outside air, takes in O2 to the blood and outputs
     CO2
  - [ ] Nasal Cavity
   - Warms, moisturrizes, and filters air entering the body before it reaches
     the lungs 
   - Located within the nose, lined with hairs 
  - [ ] Pharynx
  - [ ] Glottis
  - [ ] Larynx
  - [ ] Trachea
  - [ ] Bronchi
  - [ ] Alveoli
  - [ ] Goblet Cells
  - [ ] Pseudostratified Ciliated Columnar Epithelium 
  - [ ] Diaphragm
   - Separates the thorax from the abdomen, assists in lung contraction and
     expansion. 
   - Contract during inhalation, relax during exhalation
