* Key Reagents to Know
** Trypsin
  - Aids in the digestion of proteins, produced in the pancreas 
  - Further digestion of proteins after initial breakdown by pepsin
** Amylase
  - Aids in the digestion of starch and glycogen, produed in the pancreas
  - Breaks them down into disaccharide maltose molecules
** Bile
*** Emulsifies lipids and is produced in the liver, stored in the gall blader
   - Emulsification is the breakdown of fat globules in the dueodenum into tiny
   droplets, giving more surface area for lipase from the pancrease to work
   on assisted by the bile salts
** Lipase
  - Once lipids are emulsified, they are broken down into their subunits,
  which can be absorbed into the body, by lipase
** Gelatin
  - A protein that is capable of taking up large amounts of water, causing it
  to swell and form a Jell-O like substance
** Hydrochloric Acid
  - Reagent which increases acidity and helps certain enzymatic activity, such
  as pepsin 
** Sodium Hydroxide
  - Reagent which increases pH and helps certain enzymatic activity, such as
  trypsin
** Biuret Solution
  - Used to test for the presence of proteins, is normally blue and turns
  purple in the presence of peptide bonds (from proteins)
** Iodine
  - Used to test for the presence of starch, to determine whether digestion has
  occurred. No starch digestion = golden-brown color, starch digestion =
  red-brown, blue, black
** Starch Solution
  - In our lab, pancreatic extract which contains starch, a polysaccharide
** Phenolphthalein
  - Used as a pH indicator, turns pink at pH 10. As digestion occurs and fatty
  acids are released, will become colorless, indicating that the solution is
  now only slightly basic (pH 8) 
** Benedict's Solution
  - Used to test for the presence of maltose. No maltose = blue, small amount
  of maltose = greenish, moderate amount = yellowish, large amount = orange
  or reddish coloration

* Key Concepts
** Respiratory System
  - [X] Intercostal muscles
   - Contract during inhalation, relax during exhalation
   - Located between the ribs
  - [ ] Lungs
   - Located on both sides of the chest
   - Has branching bronchi within it 
   - Gas exchange with the outside air, takes in O2 to the blood and outputs
     CO2
  - [X] Nasal Cavity
   - Warms, moisturrizes, and filters air entering the body before it reaches
     the lungs 
   - Located within the nose, lined with hairs
  - [ ] Pharynx
   - The membrane-lined cavity behind nose and mouth, connecting them to the
     esophagus 
  - [X] Glottis
   - Opening which leads to the larynx, covered by the epiglottis
  - [ ] Larynx
   - The muscular organ forming an air passage to the lungs; the voice box
  - [ ] Trachea
   - The "windpipe", rigid with prominent cartilaginous rings
   - Without these rings, it would collapse each time the pressure dropped 
  - [ ] Bronchi
   - Air passage that diverge from the windpipe, located in the lungs 
  - [ ] Alveoli
   - Tiny air sacs located at the end of bronchioles which allow for direct
     diffusion (gas exchange)  
  - [ ] Goblet Cells
   - Located in the respiratory and intestinal tracts, secrete the main
     component of mucus.
  - [ ] Pseudostratified Ciliated Columnar Epithelium
   - Tissues which have goblet cells on them, located in the nasal cavity,
     trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles
  - [ ] Diaphragm
   - Separates the thorax from the abdomen, assists in lung contraction and
     expansion. 
   - Contract during inhalation, relax during exhalation
** Cardiovascular System
  - [ ] Bicuspid vs Tricuspid Valves 
   - Bicuspid has two flaps (between left atrium and ventricle)
   - Tricuspid has three flaps (between right atrium and ventricle)
  - [ ] Blood Vessels - Tissues
  - [ ] Flow of blood through the body
   - Superior Vena Cava ->  Right Atrium -> Right Ventricle -> Pulmonary
     Artery -> Lungs -> Pulmonary Vein -> Left Atrium -> Left Ventricle ->
     Aorta -> Arteries -> Arterioles -> Capillaries -> Venules -> Veins     
  - [ ] Left Atrium
   - Holding chamber for blood coming from the heart, goes through bicuspid
     valve to get to left ventricle 
  - [ ] Right Atrium
   - Holding chamber for blood coming from the body, goes through tricuspid
     valve to get to right ventricle 
  - [ ] Left Ventricle
   - Pumps blood through the aortic valve (semilunar) into the aorta
  - [ ] Right Ventricle
   - Pumps blood through the pulmonary valve (semilunar) through the pulmonary artery to
     the lungs 
  - [X] Aorta
   - Largest artery in the blood, located above the left ventricle and
     supplies oxygenated blood to the body
  - [X] Pulmonary Vein
   - Carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium of the heart
  - [X] Pulmonary Artery
   - Takes deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs
  - [X] Vena Cava
   - Takes blood from the veins and sends it in to the right atrium
** Excretory-Urinary System
  - [ ] 2 Major Functions
   - Filtering and processing waste and excreting waste 
  - [ ] Ureter
   - Basic functional and structural unit of the kidney 
  - [ ] Bladder
   - A hollow, muscular, balloon-shaped organ that expands as it fills with
     urine 
  - [ ] Kidney
   - Filters blood to produce urine
  - [ ] Urethra
   - An opening through with urine empties at the the bottom of the bladder  
** Fetal Pig Dissection
  - [ ] Dorsal 
   - The back of the pig, towards the back 
  - [ ] Ventral
   - The front of the pig, stomach side 
  - [ ] Anterior 
   - Nearer to the front, especially situated in the front of the body or
     nearer the head   
  - [ ] Posterior 
   - Further back in position; of or nearer the rear or hind end
