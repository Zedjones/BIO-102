* Key Reagents to Know
  - [X] Trypsin
   - Aids in the digestion of proteins, produced in the pancreas
   - Further digestion of proteins after initial breakdown by pepsin
  - [X] Amylase
   - Aids in the digestion of starch and glycogen, produed in the pancreas
   - Breaks them down into disaccharide maltose molecules
  - [X] Bile
   - Emulsifies lipids and is produced in the liver, stored in the gall blader
    - Emulsification is the breakdown of fat globules in the dueodenum into tiny
    droplets, giving more surface area for lipase from the pancreas to work
    on assisted by the bile salts
  - [X] Lipase
   - Once lipids are emulsified, they are broken down into their subunits,
   which can be absorbed into the body, by lipase
  - [X] Gelatin
   - A protein that is capable of taking up large amounts of water, causing it
   to swell and form a Jell-O like substance
  - [X] Hydrochloric Acid
   - Reagent which increases acidity and helps certain enzymatic activity, such
   as pepsin 
  - [X] Sodium Hydroxide
   - Reagent which increases pH and helps certain enzymatic activity, such as
   trypsin
  - [X] Biuret Solution
   - Used to test for the presence of proteins, is normally blue and turns
   purple in the presence of peptide bonds (from proteins)
  - [X] Iodin
   - Used to test for the presence of starch, to determine whether digestion has
   occurred. No starch digestion = golden-brown color, starch digestion =
   red-brown, blue, black
  - [X] Starch Solution
   - In our lab, pancreatic extract which contains starch, a polysaccharide
  - [X] Phenolphthalein
   - Used as a pH indicator, turns pink at pH 10. As digestion occurs and fatty
   acids are released, will become colorless, indicating that the solution is
   now only slightly basic (pH 8) 
  - [X] Benedict's Solution
   - Used to test for the presence of maltose. No maltose = blue, small amount
   of maltose = greenish, moderate amount = yellowish, large amount = orange
   or reddish coloration
