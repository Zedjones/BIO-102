* Basics of Photosynthesis
 - In photosynthesis:
  - light energy is captured by chlorophyll molecules to boost the energy of
    electrons 
  - light energy is converted to chemical energy 
   - chemical energy is stored in the chemical bonds of sugar 
 - Occurs in two stages:
  - Light Dependent and Light Independent (Dark or Calvin Cycle)
